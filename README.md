# Titanic-Challenge

This project idea came from the Kaggle challenge: [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
I built the model to generate the prediction, also created functions that users can interact with the app to customize their models and see the prediction rate immediately.

## My Process
My process can be separated into two phases. The first one is to build the machine learning model, and the other one is to make my app interactive.

First, I cleaned and transformed the data structure that can be better used for model training. The whole process of processing the data is [snapshotted](https://github.com/drinkstyle/Titanic-Challenge/blob/master/snapshot-20201206.ipynb).

Second, I designed the App for the users to understand this data challenge by playing with models and showing statistical facts. An interactive App is on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PvGSmGlsYeZLnMPUVcsgexDb_mCa37B-?usp=sharing)
